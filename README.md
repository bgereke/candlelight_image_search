Another chrome extension for reverse image search

frontend - a Vue.js chrome extension that provides functionality to crop screen captured, or uploaded, images in the browser and perfrom reverse image search similarly to Pinterest's "flashlight" search feature. Search can be performed with Google Cloud Vision, Bing Visual Search, or Candlelight (coming soon).
